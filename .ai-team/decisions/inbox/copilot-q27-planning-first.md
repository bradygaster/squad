### 2026-02-20: Q27 — Implementation timing: planning first
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Don't start implementing yet. First: (1) document all milestones and work items across PRDs, (2) produce feature comparison diagrams using Mermaid — make them amazing. Implementation starts only after these planning artifacts are complete and reviewed.
**Why:** User decision — Brady wants a clear picture of the full scope before any code is written. Diagrams should show current vs. replatformed feature parity clearly.
