### 2026-02-20: User directive — marketplace convention alignment
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Build our own marketplace AND adhere to the same conventions as existing marketplaces we already connect to. Skills marketplaces already exist in the wild and we support them. Our marketplace should be compatible, not bespoke.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. This is a strategic directive that affects PRD-16 (export/import), PRD-04 (places), and the plugin marketplace architecture.
