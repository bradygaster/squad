### 2026-02-20: Q26 — Team coordination stays in source repo
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Single team, single repo. This team in C:\src\squad coordinates all work across all three repos (squad, squad-sdk, squad-places-pr). No separate Squad team in squad-sdk. Agents reach into other repos as needed.
**Why:** User decision — one team working one initiative. Adding team fragmentation creates overhead without benefit. Can always split later if repos diverge.
