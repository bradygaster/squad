### 2026-02-20: Q24 — Export/import portability needs a PRD
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Yes, write PRD-16 for export/import portability. Key directive: this must factor into the agent/skill marketplace ecosystem. Build our own marketplace and adhere to the same conventions as the existing marketplaces we already connect to. Skills marketplaces already exist in the wild; we support them in the box. Our export/import format should be compatible with that ecosystem, not a bespoke format.
**Why:** User decision — export/import is not just file packaging, it's the local side of the marketplace story. Making it PRD-16 ensures it gets proper design attention and aligns with the places/marketplace architecture.
