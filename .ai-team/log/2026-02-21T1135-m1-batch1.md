# Session Log: M1 Batch 1 Orchestration — 2026-02-21T11:35

## What Happened

Three-agent orchestration completed M1 Batch 1 work packages in parallel:
- Fenster: ToolRegistry (5 tools) + validation layer
- Verbal: Charter compiler + model selector
- Baer: Hooks pipeline (5 policies) + reviewer lockout

All agents reported success with full test coverage.

## Who Worked

- **Fenster** — Custom tools API
- **Verbal** — Charter compilation & model selection
- **Baer** — Hooks pipeline & reviewer lockout
- **Scribe** — Orchestration log, decision merge, commits

## Decisions Made

**Decision merged from inbox:**
- M1-1 & M1-2 (Fenster): ToolRegistry design, tool implementations, test coverage

## Key Outcomes

- 213 tests passing
- Squad SDK architecture foundation complete
- Custom agent configuration pipeline ready
- Policy-based orchestration layer in place

## Next Phase

M1 Batch 2:
- Agent spawning (M1-3)
- Session lifecycle (M1-4)
- Further integration of tools with runtime
