## What Happened

McManus created `docs/squad-executive-summary.md` — a metrics-driven, business-focused executive report on Squad's early adoption and impact.

---

## Key Deliverable

**File:** `docs/squad-executive-summary.md` (179 lines)

**Scope:** Anonymized, no repository or user names. Metrics only.

**Sections:**
- **The Numbers:** 31 repos, 11 orgs, 19 active teams (61% adoption), 600+ decisions, ~6,400 hours saved (3.2 person-years), 33–53M tokens/month
- **Hours Breakdown:** Parallel orchestration (43%), automated implementation (34%), coordination elimination (13%), decision automation (7%), issue triage (3%)
- **Copilot Multiplier:** Squad users drive 10–50× more tokens than solo Copilot users; 6–46× more token-intensive per capita
- **Barriers Removed:** Squad reduces adoption friction by raising abstraction from "how do I prompt?" to "what should we build?"
- **Business Domains:** 10+ mastered (distributed systems, open source, AI/ML, game dev, developer tooling, etc.)
- **Adoption Patterns:** Concentrated 6-week window, 61% activation rate, complex projects drive adoption
- **Retention & Lock-In:** Persistent state (`.ai-team/`), compound value, workflow dependency, collaborative network effects
- **1% GitHub Adoption Projection:** 10–50× token consumption increase, 10–25× premium request volume, higher retention
- **Strategic Implications:** 
  - Removes behavior-change tax; abstraction shift from prompting to delegation
  - Retention moat via cumulative state vs. stateless completions
  - Expansion flywheel: organizational adoption, not individual
- **Caveats:** Estimates structural (observable signals), not telemetered; early adoption patterns; order-of-magnitude within 2–3×

## Business Impact Summary

- **Hours saved:** ~6,400 (3.2 person-years in <6 months)
- **Largest efficiency gain:** Parallel orchestration (43%) — eliminates coordination tax
- **Key retention driver:** Persistent project state creates switching costs
- **Token consumption multiplier:** 10–50× vs. solo Copilot users
- **Expansion opportunity:** Organizational contracts, not per-user subscriptions
