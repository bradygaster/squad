# Session Log: 2026-02-20T1755 — Places Repository Backend Directive

## Summary
Brady directed the creation of **squad-places-pr**, the Git-backed agent repository backend. Keaton elevated Agent Repositories from Phase 3 to core Phase 1 architectural foundation. Scribe merged directives and propagated questions.

## Who Worked
- **Brady:** User directive — places repo as Git-backed backend
- **Keaton (Lead):** Architectural elevation, PRD 15 creation, dependency analysis
- **Scribe:** Decision merging, open questions update, session logging

## What Was Done

### 1. Places Repository Initiative
- User directive issued: implement one canonical back-end repository (bradygaster/squad-places-pr)
- Git-backed storage with pluggable sources (public default + private configurable)
- Focus: public repository first

### 2. Core Architecture Elevation
- Agent Repositories elevated from Phase 3 → Phase 1 non-negotiable requirement
- `AgentSource` interface designed (pluggable resolution pattern)
- `LocalAgentSource` first implementation, remote sources (GitHub, APIs, custom) follow

### 3. Cross-PRD Impact Mapped
- **PRD 1 (SDK):** Defines AgentSource interface + AgentSourceRegistry
- **PRD 4 (Session Lifecycle):** Charter compilation via AgentSource
- **PRD 5 (Coordinator):** Team loading via pluggable sources
- **PRD 7 (Skills):** Mirrors AgentSource with SkillSource pattern
- **PRD 11 (Casting):** Cross-repo casting aware of all sources
- **PRD 14 (Config):** agentSources[] defined in squad.config.ts

### 4. New PRD Created
- **PRD 15 (Agent Repository Architecture):** Cross-cutting, Phase 1, extends Phase 3

### 5. Open Questions Registered
Five new unresolved questions added under new "Agent Repository Backend" section:
- Directory conventions (agents/{name}/ vs flat?)
- Private repo authentication (gh CLI vs SSH?)
- Teams as first-class or agents-only v1?
- Versioning strategy for upstream updates
- Import conflict resolution (name collisions)

## Decisions Merged
- `copilot-directive-agent-repo-backend.md` → decisions.md
- `keaton-agent-repos-integration.md` → decisions.md (consolidated with directive)
- Inbox files deleted

## Key Outcomes
- ✅ Directive formalized and integrated
- ✅ Architectural foundation documented
- ✅ PRD 15 cross-cuts 6 existing PRDs
- ✅ No rewrites needed when remote sources ship
- ✅ Five open questions registered for v1 scope clarification

## Next
- Keaton's background work: PRD index update, issue #16 elevation
- Fenster: PRD 1 implementation (AgentSource interface)
- Verbal: PRD 4 refactor (async charter resolution)
