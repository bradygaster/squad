# 2026-02-20T16:53 — Keaton (Lead)

**Agent:** Keaton  
**Mode:** background  
**Outcome:** completed  

## Work Summary

Wrote 3 PRDs for the SDK Replatform documentation sprint:
- `00-index.md` — Master PRD index: all 14 PRDs, owners, dependencies, phases, execution timeline, de-risking strategy
- `05-coordinator-replatform.md` — PRD 5: Coordinator TypeScript orchestrator, hybrid routing, hook-based enforcement, session pool
- `14-clean-slate-architecture.md` — PRD 14: Ground-zero redesign, `.squad/` structure, TypeScript config, esbuild bundling, tiered init

## Key Decisions

1. **Phase architecture:** Phase 1 (v0.6.0): PRDs 1→2→3+4→5 (7–9 weeks). Phase 2 (v0.7.x): PRDs 6–10 parallel (6–10 weeks). Phase 3 (v0.8+): PRDs 11–14.
2. **PRD 1 as gate:** Everything depends on SDK runtime. If it fails, Squad continues as-is.
3. **Coordinator shrinkage:** Prompt from ~32KB → ~12-15KB. Deterministic logic moves to code. Enforcement to hooks.
4. **Clean-slate config:** `squad.config.ts` with `defineSquadConfig()` replaces markdown-as-config.
5. **Runtime structure:** `.state/` (git-ignored) and `.cache/` (derived) separate runtime from committed config.

## Pending Decisions (Need Brady Input)

- Entry point: new `squad orchestrate` subcommand vs. replace `squad watch`?
- Keep `team.md` as human-readable roster alongside `squad.config.ts`?
- Should `squad.agent.md` still exist in clean-slate?
- Backward compat: `squad migrate` command or auto-detect?

## Status

All three documents **Draft** — ready for team review and Brady's input on pending decisions.
