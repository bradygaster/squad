**Mode:** sync  
**Outcome:** completed  
**Topic:** New squad-sdk repository creation  

## What Happened

Fenster (Core Dev) scaffolded new `squad-sdk` repository at `C:\src\squad-sdk`.

## Deliverables

- TypeScript project with 10 source files
- 7 passing tests
- Initial commit on `master` branch
- Git repository initialized and ready

## Key Decisions

- Repository scaffolded as TypeScript project (follows squad conventions)
- Test suite validates core SDK functionality
- Ready for next phase of development

## Cross-Agent Impact

- ✅ New repository created and operational
- Next: Integration with main squad codebase may require Keaton (Core Architecture) review
- Routable to Verbal (SDK Design) for API review if needed
