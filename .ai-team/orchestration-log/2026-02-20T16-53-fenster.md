# 2026-02-20T16:53 — Fenster (Core Dev)

**Agent:** Fenster  
**Mode:** background  
**Outcome:** completed  

## Work Summary

Wrote 3 PRDs for the SDK Replatform documentation sprint:
- `01-sdk-orchestration-runtime.md` — PRD 1: SquadClient/SquadSession adapters, SessionPool, EventBus, configuration, TypeScript setup
- `02-custom-tools-api.md` — PRD 2: Five tools (squad_route, squad_decide, squad_memory, squad_status, squad_skill) with Zod schemas
- `08-ralph-sdk-migration.md` — PRD 8: Ralph becomes persistent SDK session, resumeSession(), event-driven tracking, three-layer monitoring

Also fixed `compareSemver()` to correctly handle pre-release suffixes (e.g., `0.5.3-insiders`).

## Key Decisions

1. **Adapter layer architecture:** All Squad code imports from `src/adapter/`, never directly from `@github/copilot-sdk`. Mitigates SDK breaking changes — single adapter file update instead of every consumer.
2. **Custom tools API:** Five tools using SDK's `defineTool()` with Zod schemas. Typed interfaces to existing file patterns (drop-box, history, skills).
3. **Ralph persistence:** SDK session with `resumeSession()`. Accumulates knowledge across cycles. Event-driven agent tracking.
4. **Pre-release version support:** Fixed semver comparison to handle insider releases (0.5.3-insiders).

## Pending Decisions (Need Brady Input)

- `squad orchestrate` CLI entry point design (new subcommand vs. replacement)?
- Coordinator session model for Phase 1 (keep .agent.md, SDK for spawned agents)?
- Graceful degradation strategy (fall back to task tool if SDK fails)?

## Status

PRDs **Draft** — ready for Brady and team review.
