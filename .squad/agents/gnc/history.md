## Core Context

Node.js ≥20 required. Node 24+ enforces strict ESM resolution (no extensionless imports). cli-entry.ts has runtime check that warns about node:sqlite availability (≥22.5.0).

## Patterns

**ESM compatibility layer:** @github/copilot-sdk@0.1.32 has broken ESM import (session.js uses 'vscode-jsonrpc/node' missing .js extension). Two-layer fix: (1) lazy-load copilot-sdk so init/build/watch don't trigger it, (2) postinstall patch in packages/squad-cli/scripts/patch-esm-imports.mjs. Runtime Module._resolveFilename patch in cli-entry.ts for npx where postinstall doesn't run.
